# Phenomenon Demo

This is just a copy of [this official demo](https://github.com/vaneenige/phenomenon/tree/master/demo)
but I've created this as a sandbox that other's can easily fork if they want.

## Setup

The easiest way to get started is by using [parcel-bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

Follow their installation instructions, then install local dependencies.

```
yarn
```

Then start the dev server:

```
parcel index.html
```

Note: I've had to pass the entry point, but I've seen demos where simply
running `parcel` infers index.html -- /shrug
